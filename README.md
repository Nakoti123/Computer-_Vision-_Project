# Face Recognition without CNN
This repository contains code for performing face recognition without using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to develop a face recognition system using traditional computer vision techniques.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV

face_recognition

dlib

NumPy
# Usage
-> Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

-> Run the face_recognition.py script.

-> Follow the instructions on the screen to perform face detection, feature extraction, and recognition.
# Dataset
For face recognition, a dataset of labeled faces is required. This dataset should consist of multiple images of each individual to train the recognition model.

# Future Improvements
-> Explore more advanced feature-based methods for improved recognition accuracy.

-> Implement additional face detection techniques for better performance.

-> Enhance the user interface for ease of use.
